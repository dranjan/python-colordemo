termcolors: Python module illustrating RGB queries on xterm-like
terminals

========================================================================
Overview of code

colors.py: defines the RGBColor class, which is basically just a
namedtuple.

terminal_query.py: defines TerminalQueryContext, the main class for
handling queries to a terminal.  Various terminal properties can be
queried (depending on the terminal), but only queries for RGB values are
supported at the moment, since those are the main focus of this project.

color_display.py: defines ColorDisplay, a subclass of
TerminalQueryContext showing RGB queries put to use in creating color
tables.

termcolors.py: driver script.
